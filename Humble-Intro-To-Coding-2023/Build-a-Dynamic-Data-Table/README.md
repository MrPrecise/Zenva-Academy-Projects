# Intermediate JavaScript – Build a Dynamic Data Table

### Frameworks and Tools

JavaScript

### Recommended Requirements

Familiarity with the basics of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation.

### Course Description

Expand your JavaScript skills by exploring the concepts of asynchronous programming!

Asynchronous programming is a method of programming that allows certain tasks to be performed in parallel with the main task. This concept is not only important for generalized programming, but is what allows us to have fast and efficient websites.

While building a filterable trading card table webpage, you’ll explore how to utilize async functions in JavaScript to efficiently fetch and manipulate data from a separate JSON file. You’ll also learn how to combine these features with DOM manipulation to create dynamic and interactive web projects.

Regardless of your goals with JavaScript, these concepts will give you the skills to build robust websites, work with API data, create HTML5 games, and gain in-demand web development skills.

This course assumes knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, DOM manipulation, and similar.

**You will learn how to:**

- Understand promises and async functions
- Handle errors in async programming
- Use fetch() to retrieve JSON data
- Write clean code with arrow functions
- Display retrieved data in a table
- Dynamically filter data on the DOM
