# Machine Learning with Python and Tensorflow

### Frameworks and Tools

Python 3.7, Anaconda 2019.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1, NumPy 1.17, Matplotlib 3.1, Tensorflow 2.0

### Recommended Requirements

Basic knowledge of Python and NumPy

### Course Description

Machine learning is the way of the future – it is increasingly being used by companies better process data and make more accurate predictions, making it a high-paying field filled with opportunities. This course takes a practical approach to teaching machine learning – you’ll start with a hands-on project, developing a strong understanding of the underlying algorithms after you’ve gained an intuitive understanding of the fundamentals.

Using Python and TensorFlow 2.0 (the leading library for building, training, and testing machine learning programs), you’ll build a linear regression model from scratch and train its pattern recognition with various data.

**You will learn:**

- What machine learning is
- Real-world applications of machine learning
- Installation and setup for TensorFlow 2.0
- Plotting and graph creation with NumPy and Matplotlib
- How to build and train a linear regression model
