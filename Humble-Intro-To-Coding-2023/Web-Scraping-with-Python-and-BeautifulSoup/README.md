Gathering data from a web page is known as _web scraping,_ and is typically performed either by fetching web page via URL and reading the data directly online, or by reading the data from a saved HTML file. Understanding web scraping is a skill crucial to anyone interested in data science or those just looking to obtain information from web pages.

**This course covers:**

- Downloading and installing the Python library BeautifulSoup
- Inspecting a web page to identify the relevant data
