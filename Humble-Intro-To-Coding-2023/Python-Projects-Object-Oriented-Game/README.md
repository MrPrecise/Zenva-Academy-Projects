# Python Projects – Object-Oriented Game

### Frameworks and Tools

Python 3.8

### Recommended Requirements

Familiarity with Python and a Python coding environment

### Course Description

Master object-oriented programming techniques for games using Python!

Games have a huge impact on the entire world – from being able to help spread awareness to providing individuals with unique career paths. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most in-demand paradigms when it comes to games, as it offers developers efficient and intuitive ways to organize their code.

In this course, you’ll use the Python language to create a text-based escape room while exploring core techniques for working with game “objects”. You’ll also master a variety of relevant game development fundamentals such as creating puzzles, implementing interactive elements, managing a project, and evaluating potential bugs and societal implications for such a game.

Regardless of what kind of coding projects interest you, these game and OOP foundations will prepare you to pursue any number of interactive projects with responsible habits.

This course assumes familiarity with object-oriented Python programming.

**You will learn how to:**

- Manage game projects
- Implement different interaction types
- Structure. store, & display item data
- Evaluate inputs for specific answers
- Test your games for errors
- Consider various impacts games have
