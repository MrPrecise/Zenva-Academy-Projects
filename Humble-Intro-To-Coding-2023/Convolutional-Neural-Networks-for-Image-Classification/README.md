# Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

### Frameworks and Tools

Python 3.7, Anaconda 2019.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1, NumPy 1.17, Matplotlib 3.1, Tensorflow 2.0, Keras 2.2.5

### Recommended Requirements

Basic knowledge of Python & Numpy and familiarity with Machine Learning. We recommend completing Machine Learning for Beginners with TensorFlow before taking this course.

### Course Description

Discover convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the image recognition technology behind self-driving cars, facial recognition, fingerprint matching and more. Learn all about this popular type of neural network while building two models for identifying handwritten numbers – one using TensorFlow 2.0 (a highly popular machine learning library), and another using Keras (a modular library specifically for neural networks).

**You will learn:**

- How image recognition works
- Real-world applications of image recognition
- What the MNIST dataset is, and how to access and use it
- Building, training, and testing CNN models with Tensorflow
- Building, training, and testing CNN models with Keras
