### Course Description

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform framework created by Ryan Dahl and built on the Google V8 JavaScript engine. It allows the creation of highly scalable server-side applications and scripts with JavaScript.

Learn Node.js and run your very own http server, ready to handle client requests, show HTML content and read from files. Thanks to its **event-driven system**, you’ll be able to handle multiple requests and not worry about the page load time. With no prior knowledge of Node required, you will progress through a series of mini-projects, working up from the basics, including running a “Hello World” test, parsing multiple data types according to their format, and creating a server log file to keep track of and debug your server.
