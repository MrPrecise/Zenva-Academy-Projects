### Course Description

Developer tools can not only enhance the quality of your client-side and server-side applications, but also improve your efficiency and reduce the time needed to create and deploy your apps. Learn how to implement the following popular, modern, open-source developer tools for JavaScript apps by implementing them for your Phaser games and Express APIs:

**ESLint –** the static code analysis tool that allows you to identify problems in JavaScript code

**Babel –** the JavaScript compiler that cleans your code, and converts it, making it backward-compatible with older JavaScript engines

**Webpack –** the JavaScript module bundler perfect for optimizing your JavaScript apps for deployment

**Docker –** the platform-as-a-service platform that allows you to package your application into containers for easy portability and deployment

**Through this course, you will learn how to:**

- Set up, configure, and bundle assets with webpack
- Utilize Babel and ESLint to clean JavaScript code in both Phaser and Express
- Implement Docker and Docker Containers to package MongoDB instances with applications
- Use shell scripts to automate common processes (i.e. starting Docker, and copying files)
- Test developer tool guided changes with a Phaser game running on a server
