# Create Interactive Pages with JavaScript and the DOM API

### Frameworks and Tools

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Recommended Requirements

Familiarity with HTML & CSS, and basic JavaScript knowledge

### Course Description

Learn about the **D**ocument  **O**bject  **M**odel (**DOM**)  and how it gives you the power to develop **interactive**  web pages and dynamic widgets powered by JavaScript and HTML5. With no prior experience in working with the DOM API needed, you’ll be given a fundamental understanding of the DOM, including how to inspect and manipulate a web page using your browser, retrieve and modify element attributes using the DOM API, and to insert elements programmatically to a web page. You’ll then be guided through three projects where you can put what you’ve learned into practice:

**Course Projects**

-   **Interactive Flashcards**  app – As you build an app designed to help people learn and memorize new words, you’ll learn the basics of HTML and CSS, how to show/hide elements, how to programmatically update attributes like text using event listeners and much more.
-   **List filtering** app – You’ll build a tool that will help you search for a specific type of adventure by filtering existing items in a list – all in real time as the user inputs text.
-   **Booking System –** Build an interactive client-side form with various input methods (text inputs, checkboxes, dropdown lists) and add behavior for different combinations of these inputs. Learn how to display appropriate alerts depending on the user input and write JavaScript to make the form respond to the inputs upon submission.
